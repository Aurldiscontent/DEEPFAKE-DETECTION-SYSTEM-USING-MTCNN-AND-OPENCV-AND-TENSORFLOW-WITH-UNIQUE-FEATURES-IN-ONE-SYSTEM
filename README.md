# DEEPFAKE_DETECTION_SYSTEM
Overview
This project implements a comprehensive Deepfake Detection System that operates across three distinct platforms: online images, online videos, and live webcam feeds. Utilizing MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) for efficient face detection and a dummy classifier to simulate deepfake detection, the system offers real-time analysis of media content, identifying synthetic manipulations across different formats.

The system is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, requiring no deep technical expertise. It enables users to detect deepfakes in images, videos, and live webcam streams, supporting applications in areas such as social media moderation, digital forensics, and cybersecurity.

Key Features
Multi-Source Deepfake Detection: Supports online images, online videos, and live webcam feeds.
Face Detection with MTCNN: Accurate face detection to analyze content for deepfake artifacts.
Deepfake Classification: Simulated deepfake detection through random confidence values.
Real-time Webcam Detection: Detects faces and processes webcam video in real-time.
User-friendly Interface: A simple text-based interface for seamless user interaction.
